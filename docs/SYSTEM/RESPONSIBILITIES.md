# MISHKAN Requirement-to-Responsibility Map

**Status:** Proposed amendment — awaiting D-034
**Version:** 1.2
**Sequence:** SWE-BASICS-BEFORE-CODE 04
**Derived from:** Proposed PRD 1.4, SRS 1.6, System Contract 1.4

## 1. Purpose

This document assigns every approved guarantee to one primary responsibility before components are
designed. A responsibility describes logic and state ownership. It is not yet a Python module,
service, daemon, database, or deployment unit.

Rules:

1. Every requirement has exactly one primary responsibility.
2. A responsibility may collaborate with others but cannot delegate away its guarantee.
3. Responsibilities that change for the same reasons are identified as cohesion candidates only;
   Sequence 05 decides structural boundaries.
4. CrewAI is the mandatory production coordination runtime, not an optional provider and not one
   possible implementation among competing MISHKAN runtimes.

## 2. CrewAI runtime boundary

Current CrewAI defines Agents, Tasks, Crews, and Processes for autonomous team collaboration, and
Flows for event-driven execution paths, state, persistence, resumption, conditional routing, and
native Crew integration. MISHKAN uses those production primitives directly.

MISHKAN responsibilities define the product-specific organization, plan, authorization, evidence,
acceptance, repository, and external-effect contracts around that runtime. They must not recreate a
parallel agent, crew, task-process, or flow engine. Deterministic substitutions exist only at test
boundaries and can never be selected as a production runtime.

Official basis:

- [CrewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/) — Agents, Flows, and Tasks & Processes.
- [CrewAI introduction](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents) — Crews for autonomous
  collaboration and Flows for structured control with native Crew integration.

## 3. Primary responsibility catalogue

### RSP-001 — Resolve effective operating context

Validate and normalize layered configuration before work begins; expose value provenance while
keeping credentials secret; refuse undocumented provider, service, repository, worker, or mode
selection.

**Owns:** effective configuration identity, layer provenance, configured route catalogue.

### RSP-002 — Maintain contract identity and compatibility

Issue globally unique identities, preserve unambiguous timestamps and timezone rendering, validate
persisted schema versions, and refuse unsupported automatic mutation.

**Owns:** identity rules, timestamp semantics, schema-version compatibility decisions.

versions while preserving compatible accepted work.

**Owns:** plan contents, fingerprint, revision reason and diff, result-preservation analysis.

### RSP-006 — Decide and record authorization

Evaluate exact plan and capability requests against visible versioned policy using deterministic
matching and precedence; issue allow, require-approval, or deny; bind approvals and revocations to
their exact scopes.

**Owns:** policy evaluation semantics, authorization records, approval evidence, revocation effect.

### RSP-007 — Govern organization definitions

Load and validate the versioned 59-identity organization, professional profiles, explicit branches
and pools, and optional mission-template catalogue; define authority, independence, delegation
eligibility, and contextual plan participation without a static role/tool matrix.

**Owns:** organization identity, exact roster, professional-profile contract, branch and pool
definitions, template contracts, and organization-level eligibility constraints.

### RSP-008 — Coordinate production work through CrewAI

and Flows; drive bounded task eligibility, delegation, parallel barriers, retry, cancellation,
resumption, and terminal outcomes using CrewAI's production runtime.

**Owns:** binding from accepted MISHKAN definitions to CrewAI primitives and the resulting runtime
execution lineage. It does not own policy decisions or acceptance validity.

### RSP-009 — Enforce independent evaluation and reporting

Reject producer/evaluator and orchestrator/reporter conflicts, require downstream independent
evaluation for workspace-changing artifacts, and produce the versioned multi-task run report.

**Owns:** separation decisions, evaluation assignment, reporting contract completion.

### RSP-010 — Validate and accept task results

Validate result envelopes and task-specific contracts, confirm producer, attempt, plan, policy, and
revision context, persist accepted results before releasing dependencies, and ignore duplicate
completion effects.

**Owns:** accepted-result record, rejection evidence, accepted attempt uniqueness.

### RSP-011 — Enforce capability effects

Mediate filesystem, command, network, credential, repository, deployment, migration, and future
capabilities at deterministic boundaries. Resolve actual targets, apply exact granted scopes and
isolation limits, validate tool calls and results, preserve uncertain effects, and prevent actors
from enlarging authority.

**Owns:** typed invocation enforcement, resolved-target decision, late credential release, effect
outcome, retry-safety decision, validated tool-result envelope.

### RSP-012 — Sanitize content and record security evidence

Inspect content at persistence and downstream boundaries, contain credentials, produce reviewable
state-change evidence, and emit non-secret audit facts for security decisions.

**Owns:** inspection outcome, redaction/block evidence, state-change evidence envelope.

### RSP-013 — Retrieve attributed project context

Classify episodic, semantic, structural, or literal questions; select applicable sources; attach
provenance and staleness; and declare safe degraded operation when optional sources are absent.

**Owns:** retrieval intent, source selection, context attribution, degraded-context limitation.

### RSP-014 — Govern skill sources, trust, and lifecycle

Resolve configured skill sources and precedence; validate compatibility, provenance locks, trust,
inspection and quarantine decisions; create immutable candidate versions and atomically activate
policy-authorized mutations immediately or after staging as the effective policy requires;
preserve update, archival, reset, and restoration lineage.

**Owns:** skill-source catalogue, provenance lock, inspection and quarantine record, staged mutation,
active-version pointer, pin and archival state, recoverable lineage.

### RSP-015 — Persist and project events and evidence

Record typed ordered events for every material transition, retain protected evidence, expose
resumable live delivery and bounded snapshots, detect transport gaps, and provide filtered progress.

**Owns:** durable event order, current-state projection, retention/hold application, subscription
cursor and gap evidence.

### RSP-016 — Govern schedules and idempotent triggers

Create and manage persistent timezone-aware schedules, map each trigger occurrence to at most one
run, apply overlap policy, expose history, and preserve equivalent external-scheduler invocation.

**Owns:** schedule state, trigger-occurrence identity, overlap decision request, schedule history.

### RSP-017 — Coordinate bounded remote execution

leases, immutable task envelopes, revision checks, recovery, and exactly-once accepted completion.

**Owns:** worker and enrollment records, lease state, task envelope, completion-delivery evidence.

### RSP-018 — Assure release quality and operating limits

Define and verify platform support, local independence, startup and throughput thresholds, advisory
latency, bounded monitoring, coverage, fault injection, and secret-containment acceptance gates.

**Owns:** reference environment definition, acceptance measurements, release-quality evidence.

### RSP-019 — Enforce production runtime constraints

Ensure production coordination uses supported CrewAI 1.x, test doubles cannot become production
mode, product interfaces remain within accepted scope, and policy-governed migration semantics are
preserved while concrete persistence awaits its ADR.

**Owns:** production runtime conformance and technical-constraint compliance evidence.

### RSP-020 — Discover, apply, and learn procedural skills

Validate the portable skill contract; expose Level 0 catalogue metadata; load Level 1 instructions
and Level 2 content progressively; select explicit or applicable skills and bundles for authorized
CrewAI tasks; record hit, partial, and miss outcomes; turn teaching or configured evidence into
attributable Research-team proposals or policy-authorized native corrections.

**Owns:** skill package semantics, selection and composition evidence, loaded-content record, usage
outcome, miss aggregation, learning request and proposal lineage. It does not activate its own
proposal or grant the consuming task capabilities.

### RSP-021 — Resolve and expose atomic tools

Discover versioned tools from configured native and external sources; validate contracts,
namespaces, concrete adapter registration, location-specific availability, and external schema
state; resolve nested toolsets into immutable registry snapshots; search metadata without eagerly
loading every schema; bind exact eligible tools to authorized CrewAI agents without creating
another tool-calling runtime or a universal capability taxonomy.

**Owns:** tool and toolset definitions, source and adapter provenance, registry snapshot, collision
and drift decisions, concrete availability result, task tool binding, CrewAI tool representation.
It does not authorize or dispatch a call. General-purpose command, path, and destination inputs are
enforced by RSP-011 rather than expanded into synthetic per-command tools.

### RSP-022 — Govern missions, conversations, and interventions

references by compare-and-swap; and govern integrity, validation, retention, hold, garbage
collection, missing-content reconciliation, and recovery.

**Owns:** artifact manifest and content identity, working-reference revision, conflict record,
retention state, recovery journal, and artifact availability evidence.

### RSP-024 — Mediate MCP and external harness clients

Terminate external-client requests in the MISHKAN application domain; manage MCP client/server
identity, discovery, schemas, sessions, transports, progress, cancellation, reconnect, and drift;
and expose only governed application operations without creating another production runtime.

decision, transport lifecycle, and application-command translation.

### RSP-025 — Resolve engineering engines, environments, and packs

Preserve independent observed engine states; match adapters, execution locations, project evidence,
technical packs, and reproducible environments; reject incompatible candidates; and declare
truthful fallback degradation.

**Owns:** engine and environment observations, compatibility decision, adapter/location binding,
pack resolution, materialization evidence, and degradation record.

### RSP-026 — Govern professional evolution and organizational learning

Attribute agent knowledge, skill associations, tool mastery, and demonstrated competence to scoped
execution and evaluation evidence; enforce independence and authority immutability; promote only to
justified scope; and retain contradictory, stale, and failure evidence.

**Owns:** profile-evidence record, competence state, learning scope, promotion decision request,
freshness, contradiction, and reversible profile-version lineage.

## 8. Cohesion candidates for Sequence 05

These groupings are hypotheses to test with behavior and C4 models, not approved components:

| Candidate responsibility family | Responsibilities | Shared reason to change |
|---|---|---|
| Definition and context | RSP-001–004, RSP-007, RSP-025–026 | Configuration, schemas, organization, engineering context, and professional evidence evolve |
| Planning and authority | RSP-005–006 | Plan semantics and policy decisions evolve together but require an enforcement boundary |
| Mission coordination and acceptance | RSP-008–010, RSP-022 | Mission governance, CrewAI orchestration, independent evaluation, and accepted completion interact closely |
| Tools, effects, artifacts, and evidence | RSP-011–012, RSP-015, RSP-021, RSP-023–024 | Tool resolution, mediation, enforcement, artifacts, sanitation, audit, and durable reconstruction protect every action |
| Context and skills | RSP-013–014, RSP-020 | Retrieval, procedural selection, and skill lifecycle share provenance but preserve activation separation |
| Automation and distribution | RSP-016–017 | Scheduled and remote triggers extend execution without changing acceptance semantics |
| Product conformance | RSP-018–019 | Release gates and fixed technical constraints change with supported product versions |

Sequence 05 must preserve CrewAI as the production coordination runtime even if responsibilities
around it are grouped differently.
